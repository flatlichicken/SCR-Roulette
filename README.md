# SCR-Roulette
(WIP) Randomizer program for Stepford Country Railway on roblox

made in Python Using Tkinter

the main advantage of this over other randomizers for scr, is that you get to choose which trains you have so it can pick from those.


note: express and airlink are currently not supported, express does have check boxes but they are not registered when randomizing right now.
in the future, this will also support routes.
